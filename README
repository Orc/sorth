The default output from `du` is sortable, but not particularly readable.
The output from `du -h`, on the other hand, is quite readable, but not
sortable.

Let's fix this with a mindbogglingly horrible late-night bit of code!

`sorth` is meant to do one thing, and one thing well enough.   It
takes the raw output from `du -h` and sorts it by actual size (small
to large; other text is sorted to the top of the list.)


It takes one optional argument.  `sorth -r` sorts in reverse order.


To build `sort`, `make && make install`    If your system has the bsd
`fgetln` function in stdio, you need to do `make CFLAGS=-DHAS_FGETLN`
and if you want to install the binary somewhere other than the default,
`make BINDIR={your bin} install`
